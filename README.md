# Rental properties of top 10 largest cities in Finland

## Introduction 

In this project, the goal was to learn web scraping and Power BI. Basic idea was to scrape rental apartments data of top ten largest cities in Finland from _vuokaraovi.com_ (Finnish apartment rental webpage). Technology wise, scraping was performed by using `BeautifulSoup` python library. Scraped data was handled and cleaned  with `pandas`. Finally, the data presentation was performed by using Power Bi dashboard.
